# üöÄ GitHub Environment Configuration

![CI](https://github.com/actionsforge/actions-gh-configure-environment/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

[![Build, Commit, Tag & Release](https://github.com/actionsforge/actions-gh-configure-environment/actions/workflows/build-and-tag.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/actionsforge/actions-gh-configure-environment/actions/workflows/build-and-tag.yml)

Configure your GitHub environments from a declarative YAML configuration using the GitHub API. The action is fully managed, meaning it will create, update, or delete environments to match exactly what is defined in your configuration file.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Fully managed environment configuration - environments not in the config file will be removed
- Configure multiple environments from a single YAML file
- Set environment reviewers (users and teams)
- Configure wait timers for deployments
- Set deployment branch policies
- Prevent self-review of deployments
- Support for debug and dry-run modes
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Detailed logging and status messages
- Support for both repository and organization environments

---

## üì¶ Usage

### As a GitHub Action

```yaml
- uses: actionsforge/actions-gh-configure-environment@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.GH_ENV_CONFIG_TOKEN }}  # GitHub token with required permissions
    config-path: .github/environments.yaml     # Path to your environments config
    dry-run: false                            # Set to true to preview changes
    debug: false                              # Enable detailed logging
```

### As a Node.js Module

```typescript
import { GitHubService } from 'actions-gh-configure-environment';

const service = new GitHubService({
  token: 'your-github-token',
  owner: 'your-org',
  repo: 'your-repo'
});

// Get environment configuration
const config = await service.getEnvironmentConfig('staging');

// Update environment
await service.updateEnvironment('staging', {
  wait_timer: 30,
  reviewers: [
    { type: 'User', login: 'admin' },
    { type: 'Team', slug: 'security' }
  ]
});

// Delete environment
await service.deleteAnEnvironment('staging');
```

## üîí Permissions

To manage environments, use a token with the following permissions:

- `repo` scope for repository environments
- `admin:org` scope for organization environments

The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` only works in **organization-owned** repositories and must have the appropriate scopes enabled via workflow permissions. See [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) for more details.

### Required Repository Permissions

For repository environments, ensure your token has:

- `contents: read` - To read the configuration file
- `environments: write` - To manage environments

### Required Organization Permissions

For organization environments, ensure your token has:

- `contents: read` - To read the configuration file
- `environments: write` - To manage environments
- `members: read` - To verify user and team memberships

## üîç Debugging

Enable debug mode to get detailed logs about the action's execution:

```yaml
- uses: actionsforge/actions-gh-configure-environment@v1
  with:
    debug: true
```

This will output:

- Configuration file parsing details
- Environment comparison results
- API request/response information
- Detailed error messages
